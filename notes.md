### Basic steps
1. `$ nest new [progjectname]`
2. create module `nest g module [x]`
   - create the feature module first so that the following controllers/services are properly linked into the module and imported into main, instead of imported as individual controllers/providers
3. create controller/service `nest g controller [x]` and `nest g service[x]`

### Main elements:
1. module
2. controller - routing mechanism
3. service
